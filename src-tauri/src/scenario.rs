//! Splaunch: Zero-K scenarios, and the start script they compile to.
//!
//! `docs/DESIGN.md` has the research this is built on. The finding this module is built
//! on: **a Zero-K scenario's most portable form is a start script, not a file
//! format.** The engine reads `script.txt`; units, teams, AIs and modoptions are
//! all expressible there against unmodified Zero-K, with no archive to build and
//! no server to publish to.
//!
//! The consequence is that "Test" is not a preview. It writes a script and
//! launches the real game into it, so there is no second renderer to build and
//! no fidelity gap to apologise for.
//!
//! The writer escapes rather than refuses. A lobby has to reject a name
//! containing `;` or `}` outright, because a server-issued name with a
//! delimiter in it would silently produce a different script than intended. A
//! scenario name is the author's own, and losing their semicolon beats refusing
//! to launch - so delimiters are removed and everything else is kept.

           an assignment at its first `=` and reads to the `;`, so that is what
