"""Vendor Zero-K's unit roster, so the editor has real unit names offline.

The authority is always the installed game: `game.rs` reads `units/*.lua` out
of `zk-stable.sdz` and that wins whenever an install is present. This file is
the fallback for a machine that has no Zero-K yet, and for the map picker
before an install has been located.

It exists because the list it replaced was invented. Splaunch shipped a
hand-written palette of *Balanced Annihilation* names - `armpw`, `corhlt`,
`armmex` - and not one of the twenty-three is a unit Zero-K defines, so every
scenario built with it placed nothing at all.

Usage:  python3 tools/gen-roster.py <path-to-Zero-K-checkout>
Writes: src-tauri/src/roster.json, and prints the commit to pin beside it.
